(2) know abut giving working_thread and signalling thread 
    in peer connection fatory
   here is some explanation from source code:-
    // PeerConnectionFactoryInterface is the factory interface used for creating
// PeerConnection, MediaStream and MediaStreamTrack objects.
//
// The simplest method for obtaiing one, CreatePeerConnectionFactory will
// create the required libjingle threads, socket and network manager factory
// classes for networking if none are provided, though it requires that the
// application runs a message loop on the thread that called the method (see
// explanation below)
//
// If an application decides to provide its own threads and/or implementation
// of networking classes, it should use the alternate
// CreatePeerConnectionFactory method which accepts threads as input, and use
// the CreatePeerConnection version that takes a PortAllocator as an argument.
(3) remove observer implemenation and make observer to peer_connection class itself.
(4) replace addstream to Addtrack
(5) Port allocator can be given in CreatFacotry.
 kNow about it
